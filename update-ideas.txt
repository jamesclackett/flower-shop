* Assess observable/signal/subscription use and refactor as necessary
    - if using observables. The service methods should return an observable, and then
        the component should subscribe and provdide callbacks.
* Assess module imports. Make sure imported in App Component when necessary
* Ensure types are added everywhere
* Add httpHeaders 
* Use Subject/BehaviourSubject
* Jest Unit testing
* New components for re-usable items like buttons etc
    * Implement Input() and Output()
    * Output basically passes the event emission to its parent. This allows it to be more customizable (i.e. you dont need to create multiple components to handle different onClick behaviours)
* New styling ideas: 
    - fonts
    - make address forums appear/dissappear on click
    - basic animations
    - form-control
* Authentication and Authorizations (change id from number to string)
